## Upgrading to v3.0.0 from v2.x 

Additionally to these changes, some features have been added, such as a built-in [variant plugin](configuration.md#using-variants). Make sure to read the new documentation to fully understand how to use the new configuration.

### Plugin declaration 

Previously, you had to directly import your configuration file. Now, you need to import the actual module, `tailwindcss-theming`. It will look for a `theme.config.js` at the root of your project. For more information, see [how to change the theme file](configuration.md#changing-the-theme-file).

```diff
// tailwind.config.js

module.exports = {
  theme: {},
  variants: {},
  plugins: [
-    require('./theme.config.js')
+    require('tailwindcss-theming')
  ],
};
```

### Import

A `ThemeBuilder` and a `Theme` object had to be imported from `tailwindcss-theming`. The new builder object is called `ThemeManager`, and you need to import it from `tailwindcss-theming/api`.

```diff
// theme.config.js

- const { ThemeBuilder, Theme } = require('tailwindcss-theming');
+ const { ThemeManager, Theme } = require('tailwindcss-theming/api');
```

### `Theme` API changes

- `name()` is now `setName()`
- `assignable()` is now `targetable()`
- `colors()` is now `addColors()` and supports [Tailwind's nested color syntax](themes.md#colors)
- `opacityVariant()` is now `setOpacityVariant()`
- `colorVariant()` is now `setColorVariant()`
- `variable()` is now `setVariable()`
